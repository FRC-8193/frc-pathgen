# `frc-pathgen`
## What's this?
A small simulation designed to test path generation + following algorithms for FRC.
## How can I use it?
`frc-pathgen` is develop and tested on Arch Linux and Debian. To build it, you will need the following packages installed:
1. `sdl2` (development libraries)
2. `cmake`
3. A working C++ compiler
4. `pkg-config`
Windows is unsupported but might work through MSYS2.
